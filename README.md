This repo contains some of the tutorials and projects related to Data Science that I have been working on. I plan to keep updating this regularly. 

At present the repo contains the following folders:

* ActuarialDataScience: at present this contains a project I worked on some time back with an insurance data set.
* Concepts: machine learning concepts and mathematical and statistical concepts used in data science.
* DataVisualization: at present this contains a jupyter notebook that explores energy consumption data from heat pumps in certain households in Germany.
